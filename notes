You do need to have persistence for your interrupt generator.  This is not what you store for your data.  Understand that as was mentioned in another question, you need to AND the interrupt pending and interrupt enabled bits.  These are two different bits.  You will AND the output from this IE register with the persistent output from your intergenerator.  They are two separate units which combine later with an AND gate and determine the least significant bit for the IntROM.
